Thank you for your contributions during Hacktoberfest 2025! Your participation helps make this project even better!


## Demo
Here‚Äôs a preview of the first version of the interpreter in action:

![TigerByte Interpreter v0.1](assets/Interpreterv01.jpg)

## Debug Mode

TigerByte includes a debug mode to help you understand how the interpreter works internally. Use the `--debug` flag when running a script:

```bash
tigerbyte run your_script.tb --debug
```
When enabled, the interpreter will output:

* The stream of tokens generated by the tokenizer.

* The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or intermediate representation created by the parser (if applicable).

## Vision
TigerByte explores how programming language design, multilingual command parsing, and creative syntax can enhance both coding and language learning.

## Planned Features
- Commands in **English**, **Mandarin**, and **German**
- Aliases for thematic verbs like `feed`, `chase`, and `say`
- Simple interpreter written in **Python**
- Educational focus on bridging natural and programming languages
- Minimal interpreter written in **Python** to execute TigerByte scripts


## File Extensions
| Emoji | Extension | Purpose |
|:--:|:--:|:--|
| üêØ | `.tb` | Main source code files |
| üêæ | `.cub` | Example/tutorial files |
| üì£ | `.roar` | Output/log files |
| üè† | `.den` | Configuration/environment files |

## Structure
- `src/` ‚Üí Core interpreter logic  
- `docs/` ‚Üí Design notes and supporting documents  
- `tests/` ‚Üí Future testing suite  

## Project History
- **Concept Initiation:** *October 7, 2025*  
  The initial concept for TigerByte was conceived as a creative exploration into programming language design, combining multilingual commands and thematic syntax to make learning both fun and educational.

- **Repository Setup:** *October 18, 2025*  
  Project structure and documentation shell established, marking the official start of development.

## Next Steps
1. Define core command set (`feed`, `chase`, `say`, etc.) and their behavior.  
2. Design command alias mappings for English, Mandarin, and German.  
3. Build a minimal interpreter in Python to execute simple TigerByte scripts.  
4. Implement a feedback loop for command parsing and multilingual input.  
5. Expand documentation with syntax examples and language reference.
