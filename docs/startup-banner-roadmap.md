# üó∫Ô∏è TigerByte Startup Banner System Roadmap

## Introduction

This document outlines the phased development plan for the TigerByte Startup Banner System. The goal is to create a robust, modular, and customizable banner experience for users. This roadmap serves as a guide for contributors, linking creative tasks with technical implementation.

This plan directly supports the **TigerByte Startup Banner System Epic (#24)**.

---

## Phase 1: Collect Banners (Creative Input)

**Goal:** To gather a diverse collection of high-quality ASCII art and styled text banners.

**Linked Issue:** üé® **Create TigerByte Startup Banners (#25)**

**Implementation Notes:**
* All banners should be submitted to the `assets/banners/` directory.
* Banners can be plain ASCII (`.txt`) or styled.
* Styled banners should ideally be defined in a format that works well with a Python styling library (like `rich`), for example, using simple markup (e.g., `[bold green]TigerByte[/bold green]`).

**Status:** Awaiting creative contributions from the community.

---

## Phase 2: Build Modular Banner Program (Core)

**Goal:** Create the core Python program that can load, select, and display a banner from the collection.

**Linked Issue:** ‚öôÔ∏è **Build Modular TigerByte Startup Banner Program (#26)**

**Implementation Notes:**
* A new module (e.g., `tigerbyte/banner.py`) will be created.
* This module should contain a `BannerManager` class.
* **Functions:**
    * `load_banners(path)`: Loads all banners from the `assets/banners/` directory.
    * `get_random_banner()`: Selects a banner at random.
    * `display(banner)`: Renders the banner to the console. This function must be ableE to handle both plain ASCII and styled text.
* **Libraries:** The **`rich`** (or `rich-cli`) Python library is highly recommended for parsing styled text and handling colorful output.

**Status:** Core development.

---

## Phase 3: Add User Interaction & Selection

**Goal:** Allow users to specify which banner they want to see, or to disable it.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Integrate with Python's `argparse` module.
* Add command-line arguments to the main `tigerbyte` executable:
    * `tigerbyte --banner <name>`: Display a specific banner by its filename (e.g., `default`).
    * `tigerbyte --banner random`: (Default behavior) Display a random banner.
    * `tigerbyte --no-banner`: Skip the banner display entirely.
* **Future:** This phase could also include storing a user's preference in a config file (e.g., `~/.tigerbyte_config`).

**Status:** Planned feature.

---

## Phase 4: Theme & Personalization

**Goal:** Allow users to apply color themes or add simple custom messages (like "Welcome, Prakhar") to the banners.

**Implementation Notes:**
* Leverages the `rich` library from Phase 2.
* Define "themes" (e.g., `hacker`, `retro`, `minimal`) that specify color palettes.
* The `display(banner)` function will be updated to apply the selected theme.
* The user's theme preference would be saved in their config file.

**Status:** Planned feature.

---

## Phase 5: Final Integration

**Goal:** Ensure the banner system runs seamlessly as the *first action* when the main `TigerByte` program is executed.

**Implementation Notes:**
* The main entry point of the TigerByte application (e.g., `main.py` or `__main__.py`) will import the `BannerManager`.
* The program will parse command-line arguments (from Phase 3), load the `BannerManager` (from Phase 2), select and theme a banner (from Phase 4), and display it *before* any other program logic executes.

**Status:** Final integration step.
